# Restaurants list

## Hi, welcome to my solution of displaying restaurants list. I used vue.js (Vue CLI + axios) for this solution, because I am learning it now and wanted to practise. Please navigate to the project root directory and run:

## Project setup
```
npm install
```
### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```
### you should see the app running on your localhost.
